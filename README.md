Spotiserv
=========

This is a server combining both a webserver and a music-player that streams music from spotify.
You will need a couple of things to make this work proper:
  * A Premium Spotify-account
  * An application key (get one here: https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/ )

And that is it, now you are good to go!
